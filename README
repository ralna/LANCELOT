LANCELOT A is a fortran 77 package for large-scale nonlinear
optimization written in the 1990s. There is a more up-to-date version
available as part of GALAHAD (see https://github.com/ralna/GALAHAD).
This, therefore, is simply an archive for anyone interested in the
evolution of the software, or perhaps those with a sentimental
attachment for those bygone days when fortran was simpler ...
